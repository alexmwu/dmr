# dmr
MapReduce mappers running on web browsers with a reducer in the backend

##Setup
Install Hadoop (there are many problems with Hadoop - streaming, anyway, on OSX; it might be easier to install on a *nix machine)

##Usage
This implementation only supports text data in sqlite3 for a simple Word Count MapReduce cycle. This can be extended to support binary data and other databases.
